# FLOWUnsteady-CSDL
Examples and helper methods for running [FLOWUnsteady](https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWUnsteady) from [CSDL](https://github.com/LSDOlab/csdl), an embedded domain specific language for MDO. If not using the reformulated VPM, then the master branch of FLOWUnsteady.jl is all you need. Other dependencies are needed if you want to use the reformulated VPM.

## Required dependencies for the reformulated VPM:
- the `dev` branch of [FLOWUnsteady](https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWUnsteady) (as of Aug 14 2022)
- [FLOWVPM.jl](https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWVPM.jl)
- [FLOWExaFMM.jl](https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWExaFMM)
